It's a long one, but hear me out:

VRChat bios are overdue for modernization. For a platform built on expressive avatars, complex identities, and vibrant communities, it makes no sense that profiles are stuck in plain text. Markdown formatting would improve clarity, creativity, and communication-without introducing new problems.

Right now, users resort to awkward spacing, ASCII gimmicks, obscure Unicode symbols, or clunky copy-pasted layouts just to make their bios stand out.  

Markdown gives us structure: headings, bold text, lists, and inline links that let bios reflect who someone is at a glance.

Markdown also improves accessibility. Screen readers rely on semantic structure. Neurodivergent users benefit from visual clarity and organized layouts that support how they process information.

Creators and developers would benefit, too. World links, credits, and short snippets of code could be shared cleanly and consistently. Markdown is easy to sanitize, and major platforms have proven it’s safe, scalable, and user-friendly.

### Key benefits:

- Improves readability and profile clarity  

- Supports accessibility for screen readers and neurodivergent users  

- Reduces spam and formatting hacks  

- Encourages deeper creative engagement  

### Suggested implementation:

1. Introduce a new bio field supporting sanitized Markdown  

2. Disable raw hypertext to avoid malicious link use  

3. Validate input and display Markdown syntax errors live  

4. Keep backwards compatibility with plain-text formatting  

5. Increase the max bio size, it's about time. 1024, please..?

6. Optionally, provide a small formatting toolbar for accessibility

Now this isn't so much about fancy fonts or over-styling. I personally want clarity, accessibility, and giving users a profile tool that matches the rest of the overhaul VRChat has had lately. We don’t need more bloated asset bundles (looking at you, pride stickers). What we need is a way to express ourselves in our own words, with structure and style.

Plain text is the rotary phone of modern UX.  

Let’s hang up and give users the structure they deserve.
